                    <h1>The State of Responsive Web Design</h1>

                    As we move into 2015 it’s the perfect time to address “The State of Responsive Web Design”.

                    We’re going to revisit what we know about RWD, what’s been left by the wayside in recent times,
                    the new tricks we can incorporate into our game today, and what’s coming up on the horizon.

                    The Story So Far

                    Before we get into it, let’s start by defining what we actually mean when we say “Responsive Web
                    Design".

                    When Ethan Marcotte originally coined the term five years ago in his article on A List Apart,
                    he cited fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries as three “technical ingredients” of RWD.
                    <img src="img/img1.png">

                    However he immediately qualified these specifications by saying:

                    <blockquote><p>“...but it also requires a different way of thinking.”</p></blockquote>
                    Since that 2010 article we’ve seen continual evolution in the technology people use to
                    access the internet, as well as the emergence of several new technical ingredients that can be added
                    into our development toolkit.

                    We still use fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries, but those three things alone no
                    longer form a full picture of what Responsive Web Design involves.

                    Technology and web design techniques are in a perpetual state of flux, so the definition of RWD
                    should ideally give us a different way of thinking that will be just as applicable after another
                    five years of change as it is today.

                    In my view, that way of thinking can be summed up as follows.

                    <blockquote><p>“Responsive Web Design is an approach to creating websites that can respond to all
                        known web
                        browsing devices, with content delivery and UI interaction optimized to the greatest degree
                        possible for all visitors.”</p></blockquote>
                    By focusing on the way of thinking underlying Responsive Web Design rather than specific technical
                    ingredients, we remain free to strive for the best new ways of creating responsive sites in the
                    continually changing landscape of our industry.

            <p>While there are certainly many things that have changed in RWD, there are also several things
                that have stayed essentially the same and that many developers will agree to being good practice.

                Here are some of the most widely accepted aspects of current RWD as we know it.</p>

                Supporting Multiple Input Mechanisms
                We have to cater for multiple input methods, e.g. saying goodbye to mouse hover dependence and
                making UI elements touch friendly.</p>

            <p>We need to utilize Media Queries to deploy adjustments to our layouts as and when they’re needed.

                We know breakpoints should be placed not at predetermined widths, but rather at the point at
                which the design “breaks” and warrants adjustment.

                Display Media Flexibly
                Our images need to be fluidly sized so they’re neither too big nor too small at various display
                sizes.</p>
